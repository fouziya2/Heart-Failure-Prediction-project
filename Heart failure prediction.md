# Heart-Failure-Prediction-project


Model Deployment



Prerequisites






You must have following packages installed :



sklearn, 
pandas, 
numpy, 
matplotlib, 
xgboost, 
lightgbm, 
Flask,                                                                                                                                                                 




in these project we are predicting  whethere a person having heart disease or not by using a real time heart disease dataset to 
 we are creating a manual web page if we enter the candidate details then its gives the binary approximation/accuracy/occurance of heart disease
 by applying few machine learning algorithm for effective visvalization.
